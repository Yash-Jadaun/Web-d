    <h1><u>History Of Netflix</u></h1>
    <p>Netflix was founded by Marc Randolph and Reed Hastings on August 29, 1997, in Scotts Valley, California. Hastings, a computer scientist and mathematician, was a co-founder of Pure Software, which was acquired by Rational Software that year for $750 million, the then biggest acquisition in Silicon Valley history.[10] <br>Randolph had worked as a marketing director for Pure Software after Pure Atria acquired a company where Randolph worked. He was previously a co-founder of MicroWarehouse, a computer mail-order company as well as vice president of marketing for Borland. Hastings and Randolph came up with the idea for Netflix while carpooling between their homes in Santa Cruz, California, and Pure Atria's headquarters in Sunnyvale.[13] Patty McCord, later head of human resources at Netflix, was also in the carpool group.[14] Randolph admired Amazon and wanted to find a large category of portable items to sell over the Internet using a similar model. <br>Hastings and Randolph considered and rejected selling and renting VHS as too expensive to stock and too delicate to ship.[11] When they heard about DVDs, first introduced in the United States in early 1998, they tested the concept of selling or renting DVDs by mail by mailing a compact disc to Hastings's house in Santa Cruz.[11] <br>When the disc arrived intact, they decided to enter the $16 billion Home-video sales and rental industry.[11][13] <br>Hastings is often quoted saying that he decided to start Netflix after being fined $40 at a Blockbuster store for being late to return a copy of Apollo 13.[13] <br>Hastings invested $2.5 million into Netflix from the sale of Pure Atria.[15][13] Netflix launched as the first DVD rental and sales website with 30 employees and 925 titles availableâ€”nearly all DVDs published.[13][16][17] Randolph and Hastings met with Jeff Bezos, where Amazon offered to acquire Netflix for between $14 and $16 million. Fearing competition from Amazon, Randolph at first thought the offer was fair, but Hastings, who owned 70% of the company, turned it down on the plane ride home. <br>

Initially, Netflix offered a per-rental model for each DVD but introduced a monthly subscription concept in September 1999.[20] The per-rental model was dropped by early 2000, allowing the company to focus on the business model of flat-fee unlimited rentals without due dates, late fees, shipping and handling fees, or per-title rental fees.[21] In September 2000, during the dot-com bubble, while Netflix was suffering losses, Hastings and Randolph offered to sell the company to Blockbuster for $50 million. John Antioco, CEO of Blockbuster, thought the offer was a joke and declined, saying, "The dot-com hysteria is completely overblown."[22][23] While Netflix experienced fast growth in early 2001, the continued effects of the dot-com bubble collapse and the September 11 attacks caused the company to hold off plans for its initial public offering (IPO) and to lay off one-third of its 120 employees.[24]</p>
